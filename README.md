# QS<sup>3</sup> for ED

This is a program package, proposed in arXiv:xxxx.xxxx, based on the (thick-restart) Lanczos method for analyzing a spin-1/2 XXZ-type quantum spin models on spatially uniform lattices near the fully polarized states. All of calculations including eigenvalue problems, expectation values for one/two-body spin operators, static/dynamical spin structure factors with QS<sup>3</sup> is performed in the symmetry-adapted bases specified by the number N<sub>↓</sub> of down spin and the wave-number k associated with the translational symmetry and without using the bit representation for specifying the spin configuration. Since this treatment, QS<sup>3</sup> supports large-scale quantum systems containing more than 1000 sites with dilute N<sub>↓</sub>.
